I urge you to associate and interact with other young people who come from different cultural, social, ethnic and geographical backgrounds from you for an opportunity to learn views, ideas, beliefs and perspectives different from yours. This is for the sole purpose of enriching your educational experience through a greater understanding and appreciation of the diverseness and richness of the individual experience.
